A Ros2 study 
Source and material
- https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Tutorials/Intermediate/URDF/Building-a-Visual-Robot-Model-with-URDF-from-Scratch.html
- https://gazebosim.org/docs/harmonic/building_robot/ (this one is not step base but some how alphabetical base so you may came across some more difficult tutorial that require the info from other part)

For the time I make this studies, the webot 2025b may not working very well with the ros2 due to cache config.

Still the gazebo work nicely and you can follow this to install gazebo onto your ros2 (gazebo 8.9.0)

Some of the gazebo tutorial compatible only to ros1 so I kinda skip it :'(
